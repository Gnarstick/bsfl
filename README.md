# BSFL

This project is a fork of the original work of Louwrentius.

The Bash Shell Function Library (BSFL) is a small Bash script that acts as a library for bash scripts. It provides a couple of functions that makes the lives of most people using shell scripts a bit easier.

## Getting started

In order to use BSFL functions, you have to include the library in your Bash scripts :

	source <path to BSFL>

## What's next ?

The best way to learn how does BSFL work is to look at the examples available in the "examples" folder.

## Build documentation

Building the documentation is done by using Doxygen :

	cd <path to BSFL repository>/doc
	doxygen Doxyfile
